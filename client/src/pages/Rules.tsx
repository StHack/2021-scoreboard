# Rules

## CTF Rules

- Team size limit is ${gameConfig.teamSize}
- Remote players are not allowed
- Sharing flags is forbidden
- Don't attack the scoring system
- Denial of Service on our infrastructure means expulsion and adding your name to the wall of shame

> We reserve the rights to disqualify any cheating team.

## Scoring

This year the scoring is dynamic, the formula is the following:

\`\`\`text
chall_points = base_score * (total_teams - solvers)
team_points = chall_point + reward_points
\`\`\`

Where:

- \`base_score\` is the constant **${gameConfig.baseChallScore}**
- \`total_teams\` is the total number of teams playing the CTF (Currently: ${gameConfig.teamCount})
- \`solvers\` is the number of teams that solved this challenge
- \`reward_points\` is the sum of bonus points given by the staff when special challenge is solved

This means you should expect the challenge points and your score to:

- increase at the beginning of the CTF, when teams are registering
- decrease while people solve challenges

There is no bonus points for breakthrough.
