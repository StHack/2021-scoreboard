## CTF Rules

- Team size limit is ${gameConfig.teamSize}
- Remote players are not allowed
- Sharing flags is forbidden
- Don't attack the scoring system
- Denial of Service on our infrastructure means expulsion and adding your name to the wall of shame

> We reserve the rights to disqualify any cheating team.

## Scoring

This year the scoring is dynamic, the formula is the following:

\`\`\`text
chall_points = (base_score * base_difficulty) * (total_teams - solvers)
\`\`\`

Where:

- \`base_score\` is the constant **${gameConfig.baseChallScore}**
- \`base_difficulty\` is
  - easy: **1**
  - medium: **2**
  - hard: **3**
- \`total_teams\` is the total number of teams playing the CTF (Currently: ${gameConfig.teamCount})
- \`solvers\` is the number of teams that solved this challenge

This means you should expect the challenge points and your score to:

- increase at the beginning of the CTF, when teams are registering
- decrease while people solve challenges

There is no bonus points for breakthrough.

When a team solves a challenge, it is locked for **${gameConfig.solveDelay / 60 / 1000} minutes**. During this time, no one will be able to submit their proposals.
